# Qt-ROS
Create a interface for ros in QT
	This is a package create by " catkin_create_qt_pkg " command which is a ros package with Qt interface , and I add an interface(Qt Designer Form Class) manually in Qt ,set a button in  the main interface(default) to call this manuall create interface !Be sure you have changed the CMakeLists file add an "*.h" suffix in it ,or you would have some problems when you build th file !
